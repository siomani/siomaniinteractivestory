    <p>You catch up to the group and throw yourself into the fight.</p>

<p>For a moment, it feels like you might push them back.</p>

<p>Then you tear free.</p>

<p>The zombies turn all at once. Mouths open. Arms reach. They start chasing.</p>

<p>You run with the group toward the stairwell. Feet pound. The metal steps creak beneath the weight of everyone fleeing upward.</p>

<p>Zombies pour in from different directions, blocking hallways, stumbling down stairs, forcing you to fight just to keep moving.</p>

<p>Someone shouts over the noise, maybe you should find a classroom. Somewhere to regroup. Somewhere to breathe. Somewhere to make a plan.</p>
