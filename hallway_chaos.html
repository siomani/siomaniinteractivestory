  <h2>Hallway Chaos</h2>
  <div class="story-box">
    <img src="images/hallway.jpg" alt="Hallway">

    <p>The hallway is packed.</p>
    <p>Students push past you. Someone falls. Someone doesn’t get back up. A locker door slams shut inches from your face.</p>
    <p>You catch a glimpse of a classmate ahead — then they disappear into the crowd.</p>
    <p>The hallway is chaos. Students run past you in both directions, shouting, crying, pushing. Lockers shake as bodies slam into them.</p>
    <p>Down the hall, someone falls. Another student bends to help — then screams and stumbles back. You don’t see what caused it, but you hear it. A sound that makes your stomach drop.</p>
    <p>Staying here feels dangerous. Moving feels dangerous too.</p>
